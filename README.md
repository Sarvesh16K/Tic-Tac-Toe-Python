# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Python

This is a 2 player Tic-Tac-Toe using Python programming language. In this game there are 2 players 'X' and 'O', Each of them gets consecutive turn one after another starting with 'X'. Each player has to mark it's spot in a 3x3 matrix and create a pattern in order to win.

The program asks for user input in the form of Row and Column. If the user enters invalid Row/Column value (in this case >3 since it's a 3x3 matrix) the program prints "Invalid input" and asks again for input to the same player. If at any point the required pattern is formed by any player 'X' or'O', the game will stop and declare the winner.

The game continues till one of the player acquires the desired pattern. If no player wins and all the spots in the matrix are filled, the program will automatically end the game and declare the game as a tie.
